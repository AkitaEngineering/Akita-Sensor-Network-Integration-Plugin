# This file makes the 'asnip' directory a Python package.
# It can be empty.

# Optionally, you could expose the main plugin class here if you wanted
# to allow imports like 'from asnip import ASNIP', but for Meshtastic's
# typical plugin loading mechanism (which often relies on filename and
# a class named Plugin or the capitalized filename), this is usually
# not strictly necessary.

# from .asnip import ASNIP
# __all__ = ['ASNIP']

# For now, keeping it empty is standard and sufficient.
